This is a pipeline tool to allow for watching a dir that takes in video that needs to be upscaled. 

The dir is accessed via Dropbox and is constantly listening for new files to be uploaded.

Eventually, it will walk down the list of files as they are uploaded from my camera (while on set/stage), and process them, removing a lot of excess time waiting for uploads.
